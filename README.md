This work investigates the relationship between the price of crude palm oil (CPO) and chosen vegetable oil prices (such as soybean oil, coconut oil, olive oil, rapeseed oil, and sunflower oil), crude oil, precipitation, humidity, solar radiation, average temperature, and the monthly exchange rate. Then the findings of the CPO price forecasts would then be compared using deep learning techniques. The deep learning techniques we will employ are multilayer perceptron (MLP), long short term (LSTM), gated response unit (GRU), and convolutional neural network (CNN).

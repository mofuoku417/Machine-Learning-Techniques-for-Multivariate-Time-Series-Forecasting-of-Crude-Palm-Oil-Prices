The purpose of the present study was twofold. Firstly we investigate the relationship between the price of crude palm oil (CPO), chosen vegetable oil prices (such as soybean oil, coconut oil, olive oil, rapeseed oil, and sunflower oil), crude oil, and the monthly exchange rate. Secondly, from the results of the most influential predictor of CPO, we forecast the monthly CPO prices using Holt-Winters, support vector regression (SVR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and long short term memory (LSTM). Then finally, we assess the prediction performances using MAE, MDA, RMSE, MAPE, and MSE.

# Multivariate-Time-Series-Forecasting-of-Crude-Palm-Oil-Price-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
This project investigates the correlation between crude palm oil (CPO) price and soybean oil, coconut oil, olive oil, rapeseed oil, sunflower oil crude oil, and the monthly exchange rate. A comparative examination will then be performed on CPO price forecasting results using the machine learning methods. We will utilize monthly CPO prices, vegetable oil prices, crude oil prices, and monthly exchange rate data from January 1987 to February 2021. Preliminary analysis showed a positive and leading correlation between the CPO price and soybean oil price and among CPO price and crude oil price. We will conduct experiments employing multi-layer perception, support vector regression, Holt Winter exponential smoothing techniques, and LSTM. Finally, we would assess the results of the investigation by applying criteria of root mean square error (RMSE), means absolute error (MAE), means absolute percentage error (MAPE). Lastly, we will create an app using Streamlit, an open-source framework for Machine Learning and Data Science, to visualize the results.

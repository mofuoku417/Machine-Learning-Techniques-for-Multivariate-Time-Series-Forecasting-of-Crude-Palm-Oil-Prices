# Multivariate-Time-Series-Forecasting-of-Crude-Palm-Oil-Price-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
This study investigates the correlation between crude palm oil (CPO) price, choice of vegetable oil: prices (soybean oil, coconut oil, olive oil, rapeseed oil, and sunflower oil), crude oil, and the monthly exchange rate. The comparative examination was then conducted on CPO price forecasting results employing machine/deep learning techniques. We utilized monthly CPO prices, selected vegetable oil prices, crude oil prices, and monthly exchange rate data from January 1987 to February 2021. We implemented multi-layer perception (MLP), long-short-term memory (LSTM), support vector regression, and Holt Winter exponential smoothing techniques. The results were evaluated by using criteria of root mean square error (RMSE), means absolute error (MAE), means absolute percentage error (MAPE), and Direction of accuracy (DA).
